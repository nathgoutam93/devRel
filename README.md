# roomie

Finding a perfect roommate can be a tough task. But with our new React Native app called Roomie, the process is seamless and fun. Roomie is an app designed to help individuals find the perfect roommate. It uses algorithms that match users based on their interests, lifestyle, location, and budget.

Roomie is an intuitive app that is similar to a dating app. Users create their profiles by adding their likes, dislikes, hobbies, and interests. The app then compares the profiles of all users and suggests potential matches. If two users match, they can start chatting and arranging to view properties together.

Tech Stack
Roomie was developed using React Native, Expo, and Appwrite.

- React Native - A framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript and React

- Expo - A framework and platform for developing mobile apps

- Appwrite - An open-source backend platform for web and mobile developers

The Appwrite platform was an excellent choice for our app. It provided the server-side infrastructure required to power our app. We used the Appwrite Cloud to store all user data, including profiles, matches, and chat history. Our app also used Appwrite's authentication services to handle user login/signup.

Using Expo made the development process much faster. Expo provided an easy way to build, test, and deploy our app without having to worry about complex configuration and setup.

Lastly, React Native was the perfect choice for our mobile app development project. It is easy to learn, flexible, and allows for high-performance development, making it perfect for building an intuitive and interactive UI for our app.
